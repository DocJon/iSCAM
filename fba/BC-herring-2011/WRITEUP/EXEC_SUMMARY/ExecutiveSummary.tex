%June 15, 2011.  Structure of this paper has changed a bit. This document will now consist of an assessment and forecast of the five major stocks and the two minor stocks.  There will be at least 5 appendixes that 1) describe the input data and the control files used for the assessment model, 2) a detailed description of \iscam, 3) a description of the methods used to develop the prior distribution, 4) simulation testing of the \iscam model, 5) moving toward the sustainable fisheries framework (see Cleary and Cox paper) and include discussion of the issues of developing an MSY-based framework for a multigear fishery with changing selectivities and natural mortality rates, and finally 6) a list of research recommendations.

%Summary:  Three major themes of the paper: 1) a comparing HCAM and iSCAM (where iSCAM is set up with nearly the same assumptions as 2010 HCAM assessment), 2) an iSCAM assessment with several scenarios addressing (a) q with various priors, (b) time-varying versus constant M, (c) alternative selectivity models, and (d) the interactions of all three of these confounded variables, and 3) an iSCAM assessment with the test fishery and seine roe fishery data separated into specific fleets.  The side by side comparison will examine similarities/differences between trends in biomass, fishing mortality rates, and residual fits to the spawn survey data an age-composition data.  These two models have some fundamental differences in the statistical assumptions about the catch-at-age data, so results are likely to be slightly different.  Results for all three themes will focus on reconstructing table 5 from last years assessment, with the addition of LRP and USRP to be compared with the cuttoffs and catch advice for low med and high recruitment.
