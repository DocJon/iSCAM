\section{Results}
The results section is broken down into three major subsections, Maximum likelihood fits to the data, marginal posterior distributions, and stock forecasts and catch advice based on samples from the joint posterior distribution.

\subsection{Maximum likelihood fits to the data}
Although  the maximum likelihood estimates are not explicitly used for constructing the catch advice, we do present the MLE estimates of the residual patterns and fits to the data for comparisons.

\subsubsection{Catch residuals}
Residuals between the observed and predicted catch are largely determined by the user specified standard deviation in each of the control files.  In this assessment, the assumed variance for all regions (including minor regions) was set at 0.005, which corresponds to a standard deviation of approximately 0.0707.  Overall the residuals for each fishery in each stock assessment region are unremarkable (Fig. \ref{PartII:Results:fig1}), with exception of a  major outlier in the Haida Gwaii in the mide 1950s.  In 1956, the reported catch in Haida Gwaii was extremely large ($>$ 60,000 mt) and the model has a difficult time explaining this large catch. In order to explain this large catch in a single year, a large biomass in the region is required.

\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Fits to the spawn survey data}
The residuals between the observed and predicted spawn survey index (on a log scale) are shown in Figure \ref{PartII:Results:fig2}.  Recall that the spawn survey data are treated as two independent time series where data between 1951--1987 were based on surface estimates of spawn area and data post 1988 are based on diver surveys of spawn area.  More weight was assigned to the contemporary data.   

For most areas, there is little pattern in the residuals between the observed and predicted survey data (Fig \ref{PartII:Results:fig2}).  For the HG, PRD and CC regions, there is very good correspondence between the observed and predicted survey data post 1988.  IN the SOG, there is a period of positive residuals between 1999 and 2005 where the predicted spawn biomass fails to increase as much as indicated by the survey.  Similary 3--4 year trends also exist in the WCVI spawn survey data after the year 2000.

\end{figure}

In comparison to the previous assessment for Pacific herring using the HCAM model, estimates of the catchability coefficient are very different (HCAM assumed q=1 for post 1988 data).  In each of the five major assessment regions (and the two minor regions) a less informative prior for the catchability coefficient was used (see Appendix \ref{Appendix::q_prior}).  Maximum Likelihood Estimates (MLE) of the catchability coefficients are presented for each region in Fig. \ref{PartII:Results:fig3} along with the observed and predicted trends in the spawn index.  Estimates of $q$ in both time periods are less than 1.0 for all regions with the exception of post 1988 data in the PRD region.  The interpretation of $q=1$ is that the spawn survey data is an absolute measure of spawn abundance, $q<1$ implies that the survey under-estimates the spawn abundance and $q>1$ implies an over-estimate.  For example, in the HG region the MLE values for $q$ are 0.245 and 0.433 for the pre- and post-1988 data, respectively. This could be interpreted as the spawn survey only, on average, sees 24.5\% and 43.3\% of the deposited spawn each year.  This interpretation however is conditional on the specification of mature biomass in the stock assessment model.

\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Age composition residuals}

The assumed error distribution for the age-composition data has changed in this assessment from a multinomial distribution implemented in HCAM to a multivariate-logistic distribution. In the former implementation the age-composition data were weighted by the annual samples sizes in each region for each age and year. In the \iscam\ implementation the age-composition data for all years is given the same weight (i.e., we assume the observation errors is homogenous) based on the conditional maximum likelihood estimate of the variance (see Appendix \ref{appiSCAM} for full details).  We further pool age-proportions that are less than 2\% into the adjacent younger year class to reduce the influence of small outliers and weak cohorts.

In HG the MLE estimates of the variance for each gear is 0.102, 0.104 and 0.351, for the winter seine, seine-roe and gill net fleets, respectively (Fig. \ref{PartII:Results:figAgeCompHG}).  In general there is fairly good agreement between the observed and predicted age-composition data in this region, with poorer fits to the gill net age-composition data.  There is no persistent pattern in the residuals.

The corresponding MLE estimates of the residual variance is displayed in each panel.}\label{PartII:Results:figAgeCompHG}
\end{sidewaysfigure}

For the PRD region, the fits to the age-composition data are slightly poorer, with MLE estimates of the variance ranging from 0.215 to 0.358 for the seine-roe and gill net fleets (Fig. \ref{PartII:Results:figAgeCompPRD}). There is no remarkable pattern in the winter seine fishery, the seine-roe fishery tends to have positive residuals for age-3 and age 7+ fish, and negative residuals for ages 4-6 fish.  Similarly, the is an age-pattern in the residuals for the gill net fishery with negative residuals for age-4 and ages 9+ fish, and positive residuals for ages 5-8.  Residuals in 2011 age-composition data are much larger  than all other years.

The corresponding MLE estimates of the residual variance is displayed in each panel.}\label{PartII:Results:figAgeCompPRD}
\end{sidewaysfigure}


For the Central Coast (CC) region, there is also good correspondence between the observed and predicted age-composition data, with MLE estimates of the variance ranging from 0.128 to 0.203 (Fig. \ref{PartII:Results:figAgeCompCC}).  There is no striking temporal pattern in the residuals for any of the fishing fleets.  There is a tendency to overestimate the porportion-at-age 4 and 5 in the seine-roe fishery.

The corresponding MLE estimates of the residual variance is displayed in each panel.}\label{PartII:Results:figAgeCompCC}
\end{sidewaysfigure}

For the Strait of Georgia, there is also very good correspondence between the observed and predicated age-composition data for all three gears (Fig \ref{PartII:Results:figAgeCompSOG}).  The MLE estimates of the variance range from 0.088 to 0.021 for the seine-roe and gill net fleets, respectively.  In the gill net fleet  there has been a tendency to under-estimate the proportions-at-age 4-6 between the 1970s and mid 1990s and more recently to over-estimate the proportions-at-age 6-8.  Recall that selectivity for the gill net fishery is a function of the empirical weight-at-age data, which has been trending to small fish in recent years.

The corresponding MLE estimates of the residual variance is displayed in each panel.}\label{PartII:Results:figAgeCompSOG}
\end{sidewaysfigure}

In the case of WCVI, there is good correspondence between the observed and predicted age composition data for the seine fisheries and less so for the gill net fishery (Fig \ref{PartII:Results:figAgeCompWCVI}).  The MLE estimates of the variance range fro 0.088 to 0.314 for the seine-roe and gill net fisheries, respectively.  Residual patterns in the seine fisheries are unremarkable, perhaps an age-pattern in the seine roe fishery.  There is a tendency to under-estimate the proportions-at-age in the gill net fishery for ages 5-7.   The size of the residuals are fairly homogenous over time for all gears.

\subsubsection{Biomass estimates \& reference points}

Maximum likelihood estimates of total biomass (age 2+) and the spawning stock biomass for each of the five major assessment regions in summarized in Figure \ref{PartII:Results:figBiomass}.  Estimates of spawning stock depletion ($B_t/B_0$) for the five major regions is summarized in Figure \ref{PartII:Results:figDepletion} along with estimates of the sustainable fisheries framework reference points.  With the exception of the SOG, estimates of spawning stock depletion in 2011 are all currently below 40\% of their estimated unfished state, and in PRD, CC and the WCVI  are all estimated to be below 25\% of their unfished state (Fig \ref{PartII:Results:figDepletion}).

Spawning stock biomass in 2011 was estimated as follows: HG -- 16,789 tonnes, PRD -- 18,170 tonnes, CC -- 11,077 tonnes, SOG -- 72,135 tonnes, and WCVI -- 11,764 tonnes (Table \ref{PartII:Table1:referencePoints}).  With the exception of the PRD, these estimates are considerably higher in comparison to last years HCAM estimates; the difference largely owes to the substantial change in spawn survey scaling coefficient ($q$).

In addition to the current estimates of spawning biomass, Table \ref{PartII:Table1:referencePoints} also summarizes estimates of reference points and the total number of estimated parameters for each of the five major stock assessment regions.  Each region contained data from 1951 to 2010, and the number of estimated parameters ranges from 158 in HG to 234 in SOG.  The difference in the number of estimated parameters owes to the difference in the number of years of catch data for each region.

Estimates of unfished spawning biomass for each region is as follows: HG -- 40,960 tonnes, PRD -- 80,247 tonnes, CC -- 56,181 tonnes, SOG --- 116,023 tonnes, and WCVI -- 51,379 tonnes.  Applying the same cuttoff rule used in previous assessments (25\% of $B_0$), the results in a substantial change in the cuttoff levels for PRD, CC, SOG, and WCVI.  The previous cuttoff level for HW was estimated at 10,700 tonnes, and in this assessment there is a minor downward revision to 10,240 tonnes.  In the case of PRD, the previous cuttoff was 12,100 tonnes and in this assessment is now 20,062 tonnes.  For the CC, the previous cuttoff was 17,600 tonnes and now 14,045 tonnes.  For the SOG, the previous cuttoff was 21,200 tonnes, and in this assessment it has been revised upwards to 29,006 tonnes.  Lastly, for the WCVI the cuttoff has decreased from 18,800 tonnes to 12,845 tonnes.

\subsubsection{Estimates of mortality}

The most recent HCAM assessment model allowed for annual estimates of $M_t$ where natural mortality was modelled as a random walk process.  The same random walk model has been adopted in this \iscam\ implementation, however, a reduced number of parameters (12 nodes instead of 60 annual deviations) is estimated and interpolated using a bicubic spline.  The number of estimated nodes does have minor influences on the various trends in natural mortality; we came to arrive at estimating 12 nodes by ensuring the estimated trends were very similar to trends in $M$ when estimated annual natural mortality rates (NB. one could use formal model selection criterion here to determine the optimal number of nodes).

For all of the five major stock assessment regions, estimates of natural mortality rates have trended upwards since the 1950s (Figure \ref{PartII:Results:figMortality}).  Trends in estimates of natural mortality are also consistent with the trends in natural mortality from last years HCAM model  \citep[see Figure 18 in][]{Clear2010}.  In the mid to late 1970s, estimates of natural mortality rates were very low during a time when most of the stocks were recovering from the earlier reduction fishery.  In the last decade, estimates of natural mortality rates for herring have been at an all time high, and in some locations (HG, CC SOG and WCVI) there is indication that natural mortality rates may be declining. Estimates of $M_t$ in the most recent years, however,  are highly suspect because there are incomplete cohorts to infer estimates of total mortality rates.

\end{figure}

Estimates of fishing mortality rates in each of the regions, between 1951 and 1970 were very high due to the purse-seine fleet during the reduction fishery.  After the fishery re-opened in the early 1970s fishing mortality rates have been greatly reduced and periodic since the early 1990s due to the cuttoffs.  Of notable exception is the fishing mortality rate for the gill net fishery in PRD in the late 2000s (Fig. \ref{PartII:Results:figMortality}). This appears to be an artifact due to the structural assumption that selectivity is a function of weight-at-age.  Estimates of selectivity for the gill net fleet are all much less than 1 due to the small size of herring in the PRD region in the 2000s.

Notes from June Meeting:\\
Were not completely comfortable with the q estimates, but we believe the approach used to develop the informative prior for q is better than the ad hoc q=1 assumption.  Assuming $q=1$ is more conservative as there is a tendency for $q<1$ when freely estimated with an informative prior.
