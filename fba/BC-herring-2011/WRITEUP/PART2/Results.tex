\section{Results}

\subsection{Maximum likelihood fits to the data}
Although  the maximum likelihood estimates are not explicitly used for constructing the catch advice, we do present the MLE estimates of the residual patterns and fits to the data for comparisons.

\subsection{Forecast and catch advice}
 The catch advice in Tables \ref{TableCatchAdvice} and \ref{TableCatchAdviceqFix} is based on the old cuttoffs.

Notes from June Meeting:\\
Were not completely comfortable with the q estimates, but we believe the approach used to develop the informative prior for q is better than the ad hoc q=1 assumption.  Assuming $q=1$ is more conservative as there is a tendency for $q<1$ when freely estimated with an informative prior.
