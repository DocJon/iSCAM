		\begin{itemize}
			\item<1-> Herring spawn index, is $q=1$ assumption appropriate?
			\item<1-> HCR, should CUTOFF change in concert with $B_0$ updates?
			\item<1-> What is the best way to parameterize natural mortality?
			\item<1-> Are the priors appropriate and is uncertainty appropriately reflected in assessments?
			\item<1-> Preference for selectivity/availability parameterization.
			\item<1-> Should stock assessments be conducted on a risk-neutral or risk-averse basis?
			\item<2-> Appropriate assumptions for an operating model (MSE).
		\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[t]\frametitle{Summary of Panel Recommendations}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item<+> Assumption that $q=1$ was inappropriate.
		\item<+> CUTOFFS can be fixed or updated annually.
		\item<+> A model based approach to estimating $B_0$ and $B_{MSY}$ is appropriate.
		\item<+> Recruitment variation $\sigma_R$ should be estimated within the model.
		\item<+> Issues regarding estimation of selectivity, natural mortality and $q$ should be explored.
		\item<+> Science advice should be risk neutral.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\only<1>{The model parameterization of $q$ could potentially have the single greatest effect on estimation of management parameters, and as such further investigation is recommended. }
	
	\only<2>{If the intention is that the CUTOFF represents 25\% $B_0$ then it should be updated in conjunction with stock assessment updates.  }
	
	\only<3>{Estimates of MSY based reference points are sensitive to the assumed form of the recruitment model and allocation to gears with different selectivities.}
	
	\only<4>{Note that MLE estimates of $\sigma_R$ are biased; values from the joint posterior distribution are unbiased. }

	\frametitle{Introduction} 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Current harvest control rule for BC herring: 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Cuttoffs set at 0.25 $B_0$ 
			\item 20\% exploitation rate 
			\item Estimates of $B_0$ were last updated in 1996. 
		\end{itemize}
		\item HCAM model assumed $q=1$ for the dive survey data. 
		\item Natural mortality is modelled as a random-walk. 
		\item Gill net selectivity is a function of weight-at-age.

	\begin{block}
		{Reference points} 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Limit Reference Point (LRP) \& Upper Stock Reference (USR) requires knowledge of stock productivity and population scale. 
			\item Removal Rate requires knowledge of stock productivity. 
			\item MSY-based reference points require \textit{a priori} allocation to different gears.

		{Risk \& Decision making} 
		\begin{itemize}

	\begin{block}
		{Summary of Panel Recommendations} 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Panel concluded that $q_2=1$ was inappropriate. 
			\item CUTOFFS can be fixed or annually estimated (should be updated if management objective is 25\% $B_0$) 
			\item A model based approach to estimating $B_0$ and $B_{MSY}$ is appropriate. 
			\item Recruitment variation should be estimated within the model rather than fixing it at a pre-specified level. 
			\item Issues regarding estimating selectivity vs. availability should be explored (data is limited to estimate availability). 
			\item Science advice should be risk neutral. 
			\item MSE should explore elements of the Sustainable Fisheries Framework (i.e., ensure that $B_t>0.4B_{MSY}$ with 95\% certainty over two generations.)

		{Integrated Statistical Catch Age Model (\iscam)}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The model is based on a statistical catch-age framework first developed by \cite{fournier1982general}.
			
			\item Flexible options for modelling selectivity, natural mortality, \& survey catchability.
			
			\item Integrated framework: joint estimation of policy parameters (e.g., reference pionts).
			\item Model is implemented in AD Model Builder \cite{ADMB2009}, and the source code is maintained at:  \url{http://code.google.com/p/iscam-project/}
