The following is a to do list for the halibut toy model.

The key questions for this project are:

1) Impacts of halibut bycatch and wastage in the GOA and BSAI on halibut coast wide CEY and spawning biomass, (Steve Martell, industry consultant).

2) Effects of a smaller size limit on halibut coast-wide CEY, spawning biomass, and wastage in the commercial setline fishery (co presentation Steve Martell, industry consultant and IPHC).

Modifications to iSCAM would have to include bycatch & wastage, and implementing size-limits in the selectivity functions of the models.

Priority list of to do items:
	0) develop an equilibrium model of halibut bycatch-wastage.
	1) implement size-based selectivity in the code.
	2) develop infrastructure to model bycatch & wastage.
