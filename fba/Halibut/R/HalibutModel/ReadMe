OBJECTIVE: 
	The objective here is to develop a simple steady-state model to examine
	the impacts of changing size limits and wastage in the trawl fisheries, 
	and how these changes would affect the coastwide exploitatble biomass and
	yields.
	
CODE: The code for this model is written as an R-script.
