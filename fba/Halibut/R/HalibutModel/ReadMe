An equilibrium age, sex structured model for Pacific Halibut.

Author: Steven Martell, UBC
DATE: Jan 8, 2012.

OBJECTIVE: 
	The objective here is to develop a simple steady-state model to examine
	the impacts of changing size limits and wastage in the trawl fisheries, 
	and how these changes would affect the coastwide exploitable biomass and
	yields.
	
CODE: The code for this model is written as an R-script.

FILES:  Halitosis.R  explores effects of size limits on growth and yields.
        equilAge.R   a demo to adjust Fmsy to satisfy allocation levels.
