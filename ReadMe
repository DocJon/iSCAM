iSCAM is and Integrated Statistical Catch Age Model
written by Steve Martell. This software was originally
developed for the BC herring stock assessments in 2011.

The project started in the fall of 2010 and is hosted on 
an svn server: http://code.google.com/p/iscam-project/

Additional information about the software can also be obtained
from a website: https://sites.google.com/site/iscamproject/

Obtaining iSCAM:
================
- To check out a copy of the project code, open terminal and
  go to the directory (folder) where you want to keep 
  the files and use (you must have subversion installed):

  svn checkout http://iscam-project.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/

- The following is a list of svn commands that you can use once
  the repository has been checked out onto your machine.
  
  svn update         "Updates the code from the repository"
  svn info           "Obtain the latest commit information"
  svn log            "View the commit log"
  svn help <command> "View svn help or help for a command"

- If you would like write permissions to the repository please
  contact the project owner (email address available at the
  google repository).

Setting up a new project in fba:
================================
- fba is a directory (short for full blow assessments) that 
  contains project folders with a specific directory structure.
  It is important to maintain this directory structure within
  the project folders because the R and shell scripts use the
  relative paths for maintaining inputs and outputs to automate
  much of the running of iSCAM and its outputs.

- to set up a new project, use the makeproject shell script.
  For example: ./makeproject MyAssessment  
  It may be necessary to change the permissions if you are 
  running MacOSX, eg: type "chmod 777 makeproject" in terminal
  at the fba directory to allow execution permissions for 
  makeproject.


ToDo List:
==========
TODO Move Herring from examples to fba
